`nr.strex` String Processing Library
====================================

This library provides classes to make the implementation of mini
languages a very easy process. The library was developed with
recursive decent parsing in mind, though it might work well with
other parsing techniques as well.

The `Scanner` is a class to parse text character by character and
keep track of the line and column number and be able to seemlessly
seek in the source text buffer.

The `Lexer` is a class to tokenize text using the `Scanner` class
and a list of `Rule` instances. A `Rule` implementation can use the
`Scanner` to extract a token from the current scanner position.

A `Token` is generated by a `Lexer` and it contains the token type
identifier, its value and the `Cursor` position from which the token
was parsed. An invalid Token is yielded when no `Rule` applied to
match from the current scanners position and the tokens value will
be the single character at that cursor location. The special token
type `'eof'` is used to represent the token at the end of the input
stream.

Some special `Rule` subclasses like `Regex` yield `Token`s for which
the `Token.value` is not a string but a different datatype (eg. the
regex match object).
